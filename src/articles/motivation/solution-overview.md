## Solution Overview

Instead of building in different game mechanics driven by the player, let's simulate them by a non-playable characters driven by the game's engine artificial intelligence in first place. This approach presumes that AI should be smart enough to simulate social interaction between all characters on the high level of realism. Every NPC should be able to analyse current game state, game world evolution history and his own history of interaction with other players. And be able to make individual unique dicisions based on this analysis and the unique character properties. The AI-driven NPCs should also be able to do a short-term and long-term strategy planning, to unite into groups, and to perform actions agreed upon group to build common projects including building up facilities, economics and politics, organizing production lines etc.

And the human-playable character can also influence these processes changing their direction in desirable way through dialogs with other characters, and by the quests completion. As such the gameplay should feel natural for the classic RPG set, but becomes much more deep and advanced once the player starts realizing gameplay mechanics and opening possibilitis. Building up the right relations between other characters, understanding their motives, strengths and weaknesses allows the player eventually reconstruct entire game world universe the way he wants to without the use of blueprints and other strategy games ordinary gameplay instruments.

This approach seem to be hard to achieve on acceptable level of realism for a first glance, but is doable when the model of gameplay is well thought, designed and polished. Such models will be described in the next sections of this Document.

Also it's worth to be mentioned that this approach doesn't exclude embeddinigs of the gameplay mechanics from other genres in form of a mini-game. Let's say if certain building was designed by an NPC architect by an order of the player's character, it's fine and maybe even fun if the player puts some final changes in design project. Like he changes wall materials, moves some interrior objects or even adds additional room to the building project. What's important here is that these forms of activity will not be forcefully required in a primary mechanics to progress the game.
