## Foundation's Society

Due to the nature of Foundation's believes in humanity principals, strong science and research-driven basis, and also because of the clear purposes in preventing mankind future decline apocalypse described in the Book Of Ziolkowski, members of Foundation are ascetics who dedicate their lives in service of Foundation at first place, but denying primitive human passions and individualistic purposes. They are fascinated by the High Goal of Foundation, and their beliefs continuously driven by Foundation miraculous achievements. Most of the members were thoroughly selected from the outside world, and they were indoctrinated in the secret society from their childhood, so their faith is sincerely coming from the very root of inside. Their society has a lot in common with the religious cult. However, it's not religious at all. Instead, their faith has a strong scientific basis in all possible aspects. Collectivism and Socialism are more suitable terms to describe their internal doctrine.

There is no private property inside the Foundation. All resources, infrastructure, facilities, final products, and research results are "owned" by the organization exclusively. Also, there is no internal currency too. The base goods such as food, accommodation, transportation, utilities, and entertainment are shared equally between members regardless of their roles inside the Foundation. Nevertheless, the members of the Foundation are highly motivated, organized and conscientious people to move the society forward and to grow common good.

Everybody has freedom of action inside the Foundation and an opportunity to implement their own ideas or to take part in the other members' projects. The society is mostly driven by initiatives coming from the bottom. Depending on one's capabilities to attract others with his own reputation and/or promising ideas he is able to assemble a group and get support in resources from Foundation to try scientific research or engineering project. The amount of invested resources usually depends on the number of supporting members and is growing as long as the project is showing successful intermediate results.

Aside from this, there is one formal institution inside Foundation called *Academy of Science* responsible for general coordination of all parts of the organization, resource management, and judgment. Academy of Science is a council resides inside Foundation Headquarters on the Island and consists of the most respectful and trustful members of the society and is assembled by a procedure of a public election. Academician status is an honored status received for extraordinary achievements that last lifelong, and usually cannot be taken away.

It worth to be mentioned that the entire population of the society is about a thousand members worldwide only. Most of the members are working in the network of divisions on the mainland and visiting The Island from time to time. Only a few hundred members are permanent habitats of the Islands. As was mentioned earlier some of the members of the Foundation have families and children, but they are not a part of the secret society, and they don't have any privileges too.

Since the population of the society relatively small and intelligent, they have no issues with crime and don't need police or formal jurisprudence. All controversial situations are judging by the Academician council that is following the Code of Conduct in general.

To sum up, the Foundation society consists of several groups:

1. Recruiting candidates. Those who are under patronage of Foundation, but not actual members yet. Usually, young people showing extraordinary abilities in various fields. They don't have access to organization secrets and plans. They are getting promoted once they prove their loyalty.
2. Ordinary members working in Foundation divisions around the world.
3. Permanent habitats of the Island.
4. Academicians. The governance and the court of Foundation.
