## Alexander Ziolkowski

Too few is known about Ziolkowski biography, nor about the first steps of Foundation establishing process. This information was erased for a reason. There is no end without a beginning. Foundation was established to become an eternal force of the future civilization that will exist forever and will change humanity irreversibly. Specific names and personal cults don't make sense in the context of the High Goal.

Yet, there are a few near speculative things about Ziolkowski that we know. He was born in a poor fisherman family of uncertain roots in the north of the Russian Empire at the beginning of the XVIII century but demonstrated extraordinary talents in a wide range of fields from natural science to literature and arts from his childhood. He was never patronaged due to his lower social class belongingness, but thanks to his natural thirst for knowledge and the faith in his destiny, he g–æt education in Russia, and later in Western Europe where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. Alexander Ziolkowski was a polymath who did a number of breakthroughs including discovering the atmosphere of Venus and asymmetric cryptography. But the most important one was discovering strict mathematic methods allowing prediction of the future of human societies on a very high level of accuracy. As such the main prediction about the future civilization catastrophy decline was made, as well as a prediction on the possible way of resolution through establishing Foundation.

Despite the strong mathematical proof of Ziolkowski Theory and the high level of accuracy of its predictions, there are a number of limitations:

1. The theory allows us to predict the evolution of human society and the key events of its history, but it doesn't predict the fate of a single person.
2. An accuracy of prediction violated if the prediction becomes exposed before fulfillment. In other words, the early publishing of predictions changes history and makes prediction itself obsolete. As such it must be hidden for a while.
3. However, in certain situations, it is possible to predict the exact consequences of changes in the history of the society done by a single speech spread across society.

The second rule concludes that Ziolkowski Theory itself must be hidden after the first application. Otherwise, it makes possible for someone else to re-apply it again and get the results of predictions revealed beforehand, making them effectively obsolete. Since that, the knowledge about the Theory was erased too.

Due to the speculative nature of this story, there are rumors that Alexander Ziolkowski never existed at all, and there was a group of people working under a single pseudonym. There are even more mysterious believes that this group might still exist inside Foundation as even more conspiratorial society that secretly watching for Foundation and changes its fate in the crucial moments of its history.

Whether it's true or not, no one doubts Ziolkowski's predictions truth because of the "Book Of Alexander Ziolkowski" owned by Foundation.

The book consists of a set of chapters encrypted with asymmetric cryptography methods. The decryption of each chapter requires the decryption of the previous chapter first. And hardness of decryption increasing from chapter to chapter. The first chapters were decrypted manually, in a nowadays they decrypting by Foundation supercomputers. It has to be mentioned that the decryption process itself tends to be one of the drivers of computer technology researches inside the Foundation. Averagely Foundation decrypting each new chapter once per 40-50 years. Each chapter successful decryption event attracts the attention of the entire society, and the chapter usually contains two things:

1. It describes all remarkable events that happened with Foundation and the world for the previous period, including the starting and the ending of wars, exact changes in geopolitics, economics and technologies, exact results of success and fails in Foundation projects and operations. The description even contains a quite short range of estimations of various metrics. And it never tells wrong information. Due to cryptography nature, such results couldn't be falsified. And this is a clear and very impressive proof of the truth of the theory, and the plan and goal of Foundation for all members of the society.
2. The second part of the chapter provides some advice for the future. The advice is usually formulated in a loose form. It doesn't contain specific recommendations or plans and may have controversial interpretations.

The book was the main source of beliefs and hopes of the entire society for centuries since the beginning of the Foundation.
