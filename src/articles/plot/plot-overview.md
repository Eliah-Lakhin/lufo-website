# Plot and Setting

The ideas lay behind the game setting are greatly inspired by a number of classic works of American and Soviet writers of the Golden Age of Science Fiction of the period 1940s to 1950s. But it also contains elements of Conspiracy and Spy Fiction too.

Unlike the Golden Age's space opera genre that usually portrays a future of civilization conquered distant space, the storyline of the game covering period of the XX century of alternative history and taking place on Earth and it's orbital space only. The main reason for this shift is to do the gameplay universe more realistic from a scientific accuracy point of view, also making it closer to the modern hard sci-fi genre. As such the gameplay allows us to represent certain scientific, engineering and philosophical ideas in a higher level of realism rather than it could be in a classic space opera "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away..."

However, the story style and the mindset of the characters are much closer to the narrative of the classic style of the science fiction novels and focuses primarily on a conflict of the different visions on the social structure and it's development questions between characters. Despite some primitiveness of this narrative, it fits well for the video game way of representing the setting and plot, when the player motivated to explore the game universe through the gameplay mechanics learning the setting piece by piece.
