## Backstory

The storyline starts in the last decade of the XIX century. The secret conspiracy organization called *Foundation* was founded somewhere in the past of the XVIII century by a fictional character Alexander Ziolkowski, a genius inventor, philosophist and professor of mathematics who applied strict mathematics methods to scientifically prove the decline of the future civilization. To prevent catastrophe scenario and to rescue mankind from extinction, he established a secret organization based on the strong principals of faith in science and technology advance, and in the faith of the free will to achieve this advance through the freedom of thinking, creativity and the freedom from prejudice.

Ziolkowski's idea was to select and unite the most talented and extraordinary people all around the world, to build up more advanced, liberal and human society that will be hidden from the rest of the world for a while, but one day reveal and lead civilization.

To achieve their goals Foundation used to stick with certain organizational principals including conspiracy, hierarchical divisions and following a Code of Conduct. No one of the members know the rest of the members, only a few parts of their working group. And only a few members of the top inner circle aware of the entire picture and involved in planning. Many of the members live a normal life, have families, friends, ordinary jobs, yet they also have a secret life where they are taking part in the Foundation's projects.

Foundation has an extensive network of divisions around the world. All of the divisions are decorated as local firms, manufacturers, banks and other organizations providing ordinary services, hiring labors unaware of Foundation. Usually, only the top management and key persons are secret recruits of the organization. Thereby they are capable to perform instructions coming through the network of agents from the Foundation headquarters.

Due to the decentralized nature of the Foundation organizational structure and high level of conspiracy, they are resistant to the most external threats and have a wide range of influence capabilities. However, Foundation doesn't use these capabilities to gain any forms of personal benefits for their members or establishing world dominance. Their primary goal is to serve the pure knowledge and discovering secrets of nature. Since that Foundation's Code of Conduct forbids direct influence on world policy and geopolitics. Instead, they use their resources to secretly recruit new members by looking and patronaging for talented children around the world regardless of their origins or social status, but based on their talents and potential. And let them grow and realize their potential and creativity inside the Foundation using their organization's resources.

By the virtue of this way Foundation has accumulated the most intelligent people around the world by the beginning of the XX century. And thanks to their genius they reached a number of significant scientific and engineering breakthroughs including such fields as Bioengineering, Medicine, Computer Systems, Aerospace Engineering and many other amazing achievements that outperform their generation for decades if not centuries.

Yet, despite their closeness and indifference to the external world fate, Foundation shared some of their knowledge and technologies in the past in order to gain material resources required for their research projects and organization's operational expenses. And some of their sharings had controversial consequences. Few know that a number of engineering breakthroughs in Great Britain in the XVIII were not developed but revealed by secret members of Foundation. One consequence of this influence was the beginning of the era of the Industrial Revolution that eventually spread into other countries. Another, more frightening and dangerous consequence was progress in military technology production that brought wars into a new level of violence, increasing human deaths span worldwide, and also indirectly damaging the planet's ecology due to mass production pollutions. These consequences outspoken contradicted of Foundation's humanity principals lying under the basis of their high goals set by Alexander Ziolkowski.

For some, this was clear evidence of the self-fulfilling prophecy of Ziolkowski genius. Yet many were lesser skeptical which lead to even more tragical failed attempts in revealing the secrets of their knowledge in order to change the world for good, but every time they only increase human suffering and death. Lessons were learned. Foundation became more caution and closed organization. However, whether they want it or not, history continues to evolve. And eventually, they will have to face the call of time that could destroy them and disclose their secrets bringing the world to the point of a total disaster.
