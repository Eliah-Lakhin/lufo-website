## Rachel Livingstone

The story told on behalf of Rachel Livingstone, a young lady of jewish ancestory who was born into well-off family of Great Britain in the end of XIX century. She is an orphan grown together with her two younger brothers by their grandfather Herbert Livingstone who was a merchant banker, but also was a secret agent of one of Foundation's divisions. Her parents were died in her childhood of epidemic of Influenza when they travel to the North America.

Rachel was a gifted child who demonstrated extraordinary talents and interest in biophysics when she studied in [St. Paul's Girls' School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Girls%27_School) in Western London. Later she studied in [Newnham College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newnham_College,_Cambridge) of Cambridge where she did her first discovery of antibiotic effects of Penicillin in the age of 23. Unfortunately due to her young age, her discovery didn't get enough attention from scholar society, but thanks to her grandfather it was noticed by Foundation that developed this research into a new type of medicament. Once the first results of Rachel's discovery was obtained, she was invited to the Island to continue her work in advanced secret society.

Later, this discovery greatly helped in the cure of [Spanish flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu). But Rachel's vision of the future was far beyond medicine, and maybe even beyond the most progressive minds of Foundation. Rachel was dreamed to raise biology, physics and material basis of the civilization to a new level by uniting genius people together.

During the storyline she will experience through a series of challenges, but eventually she will lead Foundation, and will help the community to discover and develop new technologies including fusion reaction, robotization, artificial intelligence, molecular robotization, space technologies, discovering the secrets of the human mind, cancer treatment, and even solving the problem of aging.

The final achievement for Rachel and Foundation will be establishing a self-sufficient colony on the moon to survive inevitable world war apocalypse that will destroy all of mankind on Earth in the beginning of the XXI century. But later when the war over they will recolonize Earth, reconstruct nature damaged by the war, and lay the sprouts of a new world based on humanity, intellect and the scholarship grown by the Foundation in centuries.
