## Economics Model

The game's economics model representing simplified form of [Decentralized Planning Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_planning_(economics)). There is no private property, monetary system or any forms of personal wealth. The overall welfare economical output is shared equally across all members regardless of their input. The primary stimulus for the mebers is a personal motivation to move community progress forward and growing the common welfare too.

However, since the overall community resources might be shorter than it needs to satisfy all member initiaitives at once they have to compete to each other indirectly based on Social Model game meachnics rules.

The primary subject of economics is a *Project*. This is a broad term that may include a wide range of agent activities, implementation steps and maintenance processes which require cooperative input of several agents with different skills, and have clear final goals and expected indirect effects.

In general there are two types of projects:
 - Engineering projects that grow community welfare, and brining new tradable technologies to be used for [internation trading](#foreign-policy-and-international-trading). This type of projects usually supported by the agents with high *Practitioner* trait.
 - Fundamental research projects that don't give the community any material result, but could open new possibilities in the future. Supported by the agent with *Theoretician* trait first.

An example of fundamental research could be DNA double helix discovering. There are no direct results of this research that could be utilised directly. However it will eventually bring new fundamental and engineering projects such as human-genome research and various desease treatment methods.

An example of a project could be building Railrods transportation system. This is an engineering type of a projects with the goal to improvement of cargo and people transportation speed on the map. The indirect effect is engineering technology that could be sold outside of Foundation community to gain resources from the external world. This project requires an invention of the steam engines, then developing a prototype of an engine, then designing transportation system on the Island, then assembling rails and components of the locomotives and cars, and finally building the railway system.

### Project content

Each project consists of unique set of predefined game content that may include:
 - Agent Task Tree components that will drive agents activity for the project development based on predefined plan.
 - Types of required material resources.
 - Types of buildings and build facilities that the agents will assemble using material resources. Or intermediate components used to assemble certain things.
 - A new set of professions and skills for involved agents.
 - Exact sets of agents and their roles in the project required to complete certain steps.
 - Public reputation boosts that the agents involved in the project could gain on success completion.
 - Sellable technologies for external trade.
 - Storyline and gameplay effect that the project will bring to the game after completion.

The project may include some variable things such as design of the buildings that are built up through elementary components, transportation plans, the exact place of facilities on the map etc. These variables don't affect actual functional features of completed project and serve aesthetic purposes only. If the project was designed by the NPC agent these variables set by procedural generation algorithms of the game. But for the player-controlled character this process representing mini-game when the player can see the project plan and requirements in the UI, but is able to change variable features using blueprint mechanics and other user-interface controls.

### Project implementation steps

All possible projects are hidden for the agents until discovered. The project will be discovered once two requirements are met:
1. A certain set of preceeded projects already completed.
2. One of the agents levels up specific set of skills to make a *Breakthrough*.

The Breakthrough event happening randomly and immediately for any, but only one agent in the game who met the skills requirements. Once the agent made the Breakthrough, implementation of corresponding project becoming his top personal priority. At first step he will come to his residence to build up design and plan of the project based on the project's content. Then depending on his belonginess to the clan he will ask his Leader to help in promotion of the project by the clan. This request will spread up to the Clan leader and decided by him. If the clan rejecting in support there is a chance the agent will break his Alliance and try to promote the project by his own(or using his personal Alliance network power).

To promote the project the agent(or someone from his clan) is coming to the Government to ask for the project support. If the project accepted by the Government the promoter becoming an *Administrator* of the project. The administrator is responsible to hire other agents on required roles through the one-to-one conversations, to assign tasks in the Closed session and to control the project progress. Each project includes timeframe deadlines for the certain implementation steps. Failing the deadlines may lead to the project cancellation and firing the entire working group by the Government which is affecting project members public reputation too.

Whether the project was declined by the Government in the beginning or cancelled in the middle, any other agent in the game can try to ask Administration to continue the project by assembling a new working group.

### Infrastructure maintenance and development

Among human resources most of the projects require certain set of material resources for completion and sometimes afterwords long-term maintenance for continuaton of it's effects. For example, nuclear power plant requires fuel regular supply.

Once the project completed it becomes *Permanent Infrastructure System* in the game that may require regular resource supplies and human resources too. As such the original work group that successfully completed the project automatically becoming long-term supporting group of the built infrastructure system, and persist their roles in the group.

If the System maintenance fails, it returns the Infrastructure to development phase, and requires more resources to reactive it again. Also failure in one system maintenance leads to related system maintenance failure too, and dependent projects in progress failure as well. The failure in the core infrastrucure system can spread serious damage to entire economics. Since of that the government tend to support working systems with resources in first place.

Infrastructure maintenance could eventually be finished without a damaged when replaced with more advanced system done through another project. For example a Nuclear plant could be replaced with a Fusion plant.

Also to establish a new project the existing infrastructure system may require advanced development. In this case when the government invests resources in the new projects they also invest more resources in existing system so their work group can extend the system.

### Workgroup

A success of the working group depends on the member agents profiles. When the agents have high skills in corresponding profession of his role(or if he levels them up quickly during the work) there are more chances that corresponding steps of the project will be completed on time. As such *Extravert* agents who are able to learn other agents profile traits and skills well and relations between agents, can accomplish better management results.

Also the agents with high Agility trait tend to change their positions and leave projects once they found better positions. If the agent leaves the project, then the project Administrator have to find suitable replacement which is also a challenge.

If Administrator leaves the project, the project is cancelling. That action affects his personal reputation towards the hired working group and the public reputation depending on the level of damage this actoin brought to community economics. So, in general, Administrators of the projects and infrastructure system Administrators are not interested in leaving their roles. The Administrator of the project, however, could be replaced by decision of the Government instantly without a damage to the project and enire economics.

### Resource management 

Since the community economics is not self-sufficient in the beginning of the game, most of the base material resources are delivering from the external world. The resouce management and their spread across the projects and infrastructure systems is controlled by community Government.

As was mentioned earlier the Government tend to support existing infrastructure at first place. The extra resources are invested in new projects based on the project promoter public reputation, personal preferences of the Government members that determines by their traits, and the ineterest of the Government members clans.
