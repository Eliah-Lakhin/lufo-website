## Simulation and Timeline

The game lasts in real time, means that a portion of gameplay time equals to a portional of time in the game.

The player can fast-forward the game at any moment to bypass routine processes. Fast-forwarding stops when some siginificant event is happening including:
  - Storyline events.
  - Important publication in the Jouranl of Foundation.
  - Interaction with some other agent begins.
  - The player started some routine work that has finished.
  - New project has started, finished or cancelled.
  - Failure in the system infrastructure has happend.
  - Significant changes in political structure.
  - Singificant geopolitical event.

The player can configure stopper-events in the User Interface.

When the game is fast-forwarding, game world is simulated and evolving completely by the game engine based on the gameplay models. When the player starts new game, the game engine randomizes all agent profiles and simulates game world from the beginning evolving the system until certain conditions met: beginning projects are built, the Island map infrastructure developed. During the simulation game agents interact to each other, establishing relations, growing and loosing reputation and establishing alliances and clans. Since that by the beginning of the game each gameplay social situation is unique and has a unique history of evolution, and the possible challanges for the player could vary too.

Each game agent(including player's controlled) has a limited lifespan when he is getting old and eventually dying because of the age or diseases. Both issues could be overcame through a set of advanced research projects completed on time. The player looses the game if he is dying or if the community became revealed before it stands self-sufficient moon colony. The player wins the game when the final research project completed.
