## Interaction Model

There are three ways of information distribution between agents:

  1. Public distribution through The Journal of Foundation in a form of a news digest.
  2. Closed session of a group of agents.
  3. Personal private conversation between two agents.

### The Journal of Foundation

Journal's digest used to spread public information related to projects in a form of a journal article across all agents:
  - Announce a project, it's key ideas, goals, required resources, time estimations.
  - Report project's general progress.
  - Report personal research and engineering achievements in a project.
  - Opened positions in a project.
  - Boost or criticise previously published articles to raise or lower their effect.

Public distributions may influence other agent's desirability to support certain initiatives based on their personal interests and traits. Positive progress towards the project completion raises project member's personal reputation in the community and the overall interest towards the project, but failures may lower these metrics. As such, agents with high Secretivity trait level tend to hide this information in the public field.

Article's attention effect depends on the publisher's general reputation. The higher reputation is the more agents "read" the article and react the article.

When the agent publishes an item he is able to also refer some relevant articles published previously by other agents. Depending on the publishing article effect this may raise or lower other agent's reputation slightly and boost/reduce the effect of referred article accordingly.

For the player the digest list is accessible through the User Interface for reading. To publish an item there is a mini-game when the player comes to his own residence to work on the article, then picking possible item goals and references, and then come into Department of Information and ask NPC to publish the article.

Also the Journal is used to spread storytelling events in the game too.

### Closed session

Closed sessions are for the project members only to coordinate their work progress, assigning/reassigning tasks and to understanding task's progress. The sessions assembling regularly by the project's administrator initiative depending on the project needs. All agents invited to the session gain complete information on other members progress and roles. However this information is hidden to the agents outside of the project by default, but could be revealed through the private communication outside of the session.

When the player taking a role as a project administrator he is able to assemble the session thought the User Interface by scheduling session's place and time. Once all members come to the meeting place they can be managed through the UI too.

### Private conversation

Private conversations happening between agents in a form of dialog when one agent approaches another agent. There are certain options for the agent in dialog such as:
  - Asking for the issues other agent is facing in his work.
  - Asking to help in personal work issues.
  - Discovering other agent personal profile features through the dialog options.
  - Asking for the hidden information on the project progression.
  - Asking for the 3rd party agent hidden profile information.
  - Asking for the other agent of his personal strategical goals and the current strategical plans.
  - Set other agent strategy plans and details.

The success of conversation depends on several factors:
  - Level of trust between agents.
  - Emotional profiles congruence and communcation skills.
  - Agent's general reputation.
  - Mutual interests.

For NPC agents the process of one-to-one conversations are driven by the game engine. When the playable character participates in dialog with NPC agent there is a User Interface showing all social information gathered by the player in graphs, schemes and tables, and the dialog options that the player can try in conversations with the NPC agent to enrich certain items of the scheme. The success of conversation between non-playable character and player-controlled character depends on the same metrics as between two NPCs, except emotional profiles congruence check. Checking of the congruence is a mini-game when the player should pass through the logically equal dialog options that have different emotional emphasis. Choosing the right emphasis, among other factors, leads the player to success in conversation.
