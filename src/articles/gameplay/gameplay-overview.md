# Gameplay

The gameplay takes place on the isometric view tile map set when the player controls his avatar-character through the point-and-click mechanics to explore a big open world.

The map consists of a number of objects including elements of terrain landscape, plants, cliffs, rivers, etc, and the elements of the build facilities such as buildings, various engineering constructions, bridges, tunnels, roads, habitation domes, transportation vehicles and many other.

All elements of the map procedurally generated based on a number of smaller predefined components such as walls, rooves, interior objects, etc.

The player can step into the buildings and its' rooms, interact with objects inside the buildings including electronic devices, computers, control panels, buttons, leverages, mechanisms, elevators, books, and some other small objects. He can read texts and messages found in books and devices, and keep them as notes in the UI.

There is one primary map in the game where the main action taking place and is available for exploring by the player's controlled character. The player can use vehicles to travel on the map faster. An example of such transportations could be, for example, ships to travel by water, a Spacecraft to travel to the moon and back, and the monorail train to travel on the Island's map.

The primary game map is a tropical Island. At the beginning of the game, the Island map is already developed. The player and the community of characters keep developing and evolving it until another point of time from which they will relocate to the map of the Moon site with the different set of content to establish moon base from scratch. For details see [Plot and Setting](#plot-and-setting) section.

All permanent non-playable characters in the game are completely independent and procedurally generated units that have the same capabilities as the playable character does. They live their own life in the game world and interacting with each other as well as to the playable character, and the same way the playable character does. Both playable and non-playable characters can initiate dialogues with each other, take part in quests, building up social relationships, assembling new buildings, facilities, and goods, advancing researches and economics of the game. The non-playable characters are driven by the game AI simulation models.

The overall number of the non-playable characters actively simulated by the primary game AI is around a hundred of units. But the game engine also simulates more units that reveals on the map temporary from time to time, and not available for interaction. They perform direct predefined scenario-driven actions only or is a part of the environment. Examples of such units are robots, animals, the temporary visitors of the Island and the storyline characters.

The list of base actions that simulated NPCs can do are:
 - Walking to a specific place on the map by foot, using vehicles or any other transportations.
 - Getting an object to be delivered to another place.
 - Applying the object to the target place, facility or giving it to another agent.
 - Getting a construction device.
 - Working with a specific facility. This includes assembling devices, vehicles, mechanisms. Also taking part in the construction of the building, working on researches in labs, etc.
 - Initiating conversation session with another agent to set or receive directs, and to gather or to provide information.
 - Performing everyday and regular objectives such as sleep, rest, recreation, medical examinations, etc.

The dialog options and the quests are not predefined(except a few storyline events) and completely based on the current gameplay situation that dynamically changing.

The primary ways of walking thought the game are:
 - By interacting with other NPCs, understanding connections between them based on gathered data and influencing characters through dialogs and quest completion to achieve desirable goals.
 - Leveling up personal skills, but also helping other characters to level up their skills too.
 - Taking part in research and engineering projects and/or organizing own projects.
 - Taking part in existing "tribes" and/or organizing a new one.
 - Building up personal political influence, and changing the overall character's community policy in various ways.
 - Technological progression of the overall community.

Any forms of fight interactions or violence mechanics are missing in the game. The game is primarily focused on social interactions and the development of the game world in a purely peaceful way.
