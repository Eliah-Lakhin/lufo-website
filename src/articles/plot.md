## Backstory

The story line starts in the last decade of the XIX century. The secret conspiracy organization called *Foundation* was founded somewhere in the past of the XVIII century by a fictional character Alexander Ziolkowski, genious inventor, philosophist and professor of mathematics who applied strict mathematics methods to scientifically proof the decline of the future civilization. To prevent catastrophy scenario and to rescue mankind from extinction, he established secret organization based on the strong principals of faith in science and technology advance, and in faith of the man freewill to achieve this advance through the freedom of thinking, creativity and the freedom from prejudice.

Ziolkowski idea was to select and unite the most talanted and extraordinary people all around the world, to become a new more advanced, liberal and humanity society that will be hidden from the rest of the world for a while, but one day reveal and lead the civilization.

To achieve their goals Foundation used to stick with certain organizational principals including conspiracy, hierarchical divsions and following a Code of Conduct. No one of the members know the rest of the members, only a few part of their working group. And only a few members of the top inner circle aware of the entire picture and involved in planning. Many of the members live normal life, have a family, friends, ordinary job, yet they also have secret life where they are taking part in Foundation's projects.

Foundation have extensive network of divisions around the world. All of the devisions are decorated as local firms, manufactures, banks and other organizations providing ordinary services, hiring labors unaware of Foundation. Usually only the top management and key persons are secret recruits of the organization. Thereby they are capable to perform instructions coming through the network of agents from the Foundation headquarters.

Due to the decenetralized nature of the Foundation organizational structure and high level of conspiracy, they are resistent to the most external threats, and have wide range of influence capabilities. However, Foundation doesn't use these capabilities to gain any forms of personal benefits for their members, or establishing world dominance. Their primary goal is to serve the pure knowledge and discovering secrets of nature. Since that Foundation's Code of Conduct forbids direct influention to the world policy and geopolitics. Instead they use their resources to secretly recruit new members by looking and patronaging for talanted children around the world regardless of their origins or social status, but based on their talants and potential. And letting them grow and realize their potential and creativity inside Foundation using their organization's resources.

By the virtue of this way Foundation has accumulated the most intelligent people around the world by the beginning of the XX century. And thanks to their genius they reached a number of significant scientific and engineering breakthroughs including such fields as Bioengineering, Medicine, Computer Systems, Aerospce Engineering and many other amazing achievements that outperform their generation for decades if not centuries.

Yet, despite their closeness and indifference to the external world fate, Foundation shared some of their knowledges and technologies in the past in order to gain material resources required for their research projects and organization's operational expenses. And some of their sharings had controversial consequences. Few know that a number of engineering breakthroughts in Great Britain in the XVIII were not developed, but revealed by secret members of Foundation. One consequence of this influence was beginning of the era of Industrial Revolution that eventually spreaded into other countries. Another, more frightening and dangerous consequence was a progress in military technology production that brought wars into a new level of violance, increasing human deaths worldwide multiple, and also indirectly damaging planet's ecology due to mass production polutions. These consequences outspoken controdicted of Foundation's humanity principals lying under the basis of their high goals set by Alexander Ziolkowski.

For some this was a clear evidance of self-fulfilling prophecy of Ziolkowski genius. Yet many were lesser sceptical which lead to even more tragical failed attempts in revealing of secrets of their knowledges in order to change the world for good, but everytime only increasing human suffering and death. Lessons were learned. Foundation became more caution and closed organization. However, whether they want it or not, the history continues to evolve. And eventually they will have to face the call of time that could destroy them and disclose their secrets brining the world to the point of a total disaster.

## The Island

Foundation established their central base long time ago on the lone isolated island somewhere in Pacific Ocean yet hidden and undiscovered by the rest of civilization. The Island is a bastion of entire organization, where Foundation do their key researches, collecting and storing results, building up research labs and facilities, providing scientific experiments. Strategic planning and it's divisions management, logistics and secret operations on the mainland is also in charge by the Headquarters built on the Island.

![The Island illustration](../images/island.jpg)

There is a whole town built on the Island using entire range of the top engineer thinking reached by Foundation scientists, engineers and inventors. There are research labs, administrative and utility buildings, entertainments, medicine centers, residencies for the Island's permanent habitants and guests. The city is powered by electricity based on Nuclear energy, has magnetic levitation trains transportation network, electrocars, helicopters, supercomputer centers and computer networks. There is even some level of robotisation and automation. Yet, having all set of technology advances and high standars of living comfort for it's habitants in XIX century that is comparable to the rest of civilzation XXI century future level of progress, the town's planning policy still carying of the Island ecology combining urban facilities and leaving space for nature grow. Thereby the Island scientists town is a high tech, but green city.

One of the most remarkable projects of Foundation is a Space program finished just recently. These are just first steps in the aerospace engineering field done by Foundation, but they already built a cosmodrome on the Island and successfully launched several space missions to set orbital satellites establishing transcontinental radio communication used by Foundation divisions and agents.

Another remarkable facility is a Palace of Science &ndash; Foundation Headquarters administrative building, a place of the Foundation high council assembly, and a central storage of knowledge of all Foundation's inventions and discoveries. This is a heart of entire organization, and the most guarded place.

With all glorious achievements of Foundation, the Island is not a self-sufficient colony. Town's internal economy and Foundation's projects are heavily tied to deliveries from the external world through the network of mainland divisions. This includes produce or buy all sort of multi-step production line intermediate components required for specific project, to the habitant everyday supplies. Thanks to the high level of security standards and well-organized logistic system between Foundation's world-wide network of divisions built-in into the local regional economics of countries, Foundation is able to organize high technology mass production in decentralized fashion, but still keeping it secure. Such as each division framed to a local manufacture, assembling or buying one specific component of production line and sending it to the next division on the opposite side of the world. But each local manufacture labors unable to see the big picture, and as such unaware of the purpose of specific detail they are assembling. To them it looks like just an ordinary production order like any other order they normally fulfill. All intermediate components eventually came to the Island where local habitants assembling them to the final product.

Despite the extra complexity of logistic system and security expanses of Foundation this approach was quite efficient in the past, when the external world technologies and economics were pure developed. Because contrary to the external world they utilized advanced production approaches such as mass production much earlier than the external world invented it too.

In a nowadays highly conspirated Foundation world-wide production system efficiency has decreased dramatically. External civilization progress leads to grow of internaltional communications and trading. So, Foundation now has to spent up to 90-95% of it's world-wide divisions netwrok resources just to keep the system itself and the Island secure and hidden and preventing leakages. Foundation is now in stagnation and on the verge of crisis when they will not be able to maintain their conspiracy model, and eventually will be exposed.

## Alexander Ziolkowski

Too few is known about Ziolkowski biography, nor about the first steps of Foundation establishing process. This information was erased for a reason. There is no end without beginning. That's a main property of infinity. Foundation was established to become an eternal force of the future civilization that will exist forever and will change humanity irreversibly. Specific names and personal cults don't make sense in context of the High Goal.

Yet, there are a few near speculative things about Ziolkowski that we know. He was born in a poor fisherman family of uncertain roots in the north of Russian Empire in the beginning of XVIII century, but demonstrated extraordinary talants in a wide range of fields from natural science to liturature and arts from his childhood. He was never patronaged due to his lower social class belongingness, but thanks to his natural thirst to knowledge and the faith in his destiny, he gоt education in Russia, and later in Western Europe where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. Alexander Ziolkowski was a polymoth how did a number of breakthoughs including discovering atmosphere of Venus and asymmetric cryptography. But the most important one was discovering strict mathematic methods allowing prediction of the future of the human societies of the very high level of accuracy. As such the main prediction about the future civilization catastrophy decline was done, as well as prediction on the possible way of resolution through establishing Foundation.

Despite the strong mathematical proove of Ziolkowsky Theory and the high level of accuracy of it's predictions, there are a number of limitations:

1. The theory allows to predict evolution of the human society and the key events of it's history, it doesn't predict the fate of a single person.
2. The accuracy of prediction violates if the prediction become exposed before fulfillment. In other words early publishing of predictions changes the history and makes prediction itself obsolete. As such it must be hidden for a while.
3. However, in certain situations it is possible to predict exact consequences of changes in history of the society done by a single speach spreaded for the society.

The second rule concludes that Ziolkowsky Theory itself must be hidden after the first application. Otherwise, it makes possible for someone else to re-apply it again and get the results of predictions revealed beforehand, making them effectively obsolete. Since of that the knowledge about the Theory was erased too.

Due to speculative nature of this story there are rumors that Alexander Ziolkowsky never existed at all, and there was a group of people working under a single pseudonym. There are even more mysterious believes that this group might still exist inside Foundation as even more conspirated society that secretly watching for Foundation and changes it's fate in the crucial moments of it's history.

Whether it's true or not, no one doubts Ziolkowsky predictions truth because of the "Book of Alexander Ziolkowski" owned by Foundation.

The book consists of a set of chapters encrypted with assymetric cryptography methods. Decryption of each chapter requires decryption of the previous chapter first. And hardness of decryption increasing from chapter to chapter. The first chapters were decrypted manually, in a nowadays they decrypting by Foundation supercomputers. Has to be mentioned that decryption process itself tends to be one of the driver of computer technology researches inside Foundation. Everagely Foundation decrypting each new chapter once per decade. Each chapter succssful decryption event attracts attention of entire society, and the chapter contains two things:

1. It describes all remarkable events that happened with Foundation and the world for the previous period, including starting and ending of wars, exact changes in geopolitics, economics and technologies, exact results of succsess and fails in Foundation projects and operations. Tge description even contains quite short range of estimations of various metrics. And it tells never wrong information. Due to cryptography nature such results couldn't be falsify. And this is a clear and very impressives proovness of truth of the theory, and the plan and goal of Foundation for all members of the society.
2. The second part of the chapter provides some advices for the future. The advices are usully formulated in a loose form. They don't contain specific recommendations or plans, and usually presume different interpretations.

The book was a main source of believes and hopes of entire society for centuries since the beginning of Foundation.
