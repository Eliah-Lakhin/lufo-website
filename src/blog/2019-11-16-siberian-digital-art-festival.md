# Siberian Digital Art Festival 2019

*Nov 16, 2019*

It was a pleasure for me to attend at the local event [Siberian Digital Art Festival](https://vk.com/sdaf54) in Novosibirsk. And the first time I had a chance to tell about my project in public. Unfortunately, we had an issue with video recording, but I'm glad to share my [Presentation Slides](/slides/2019-11-16-siberian-digital-art-festival/) in Russian with you.
